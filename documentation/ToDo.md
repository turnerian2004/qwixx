A list of fixes or features that need to be built for Qwixx to be in a state of useable:

1. When the user makes their last allowed move, all the available btn options must be deleted

2. When the public number matches an available colour number, currently all coloured options are removed. Instead, the single available colour number should be removed with both the public number and all other coloured options remaining.

3. Update the UserInteraction md file to reflect the most recent guard clauses in the reducer function.
